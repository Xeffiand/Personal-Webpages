    <h3>About me</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
        I consider myself a modest and easy-going person, who enjoys getting things
        done. With a high level of determination and perseverance. I take on challenges
        and solve problems. I’m growth oriented: I like discovering & learning new
        things. My goal is creating value for others, and leaving a positive and
        lasting impression. People view me as helpful, sympathetic, full of humor
        and easy to talk to.<br><br>
        After defending my BSc dissertation, the thesis committee recognized and
        valued my strong analytical ability, and awarded me a grade of 9 out of 10.
        Ever since, I’ve applied this ability in the workplace; getting to the
        core of any problem/challenge and applying effective solutions.
